# UE-AD-FINAL-PROJECT

The project is composed of 4 services each one with its own folder. The services are:
* `movie` (GraphQL)
* `showtime` (gRPC)
* `booking` (gRPC)
* `user` (the only one accessed through a REST API)

Each service runs using Python 3.10

Inside each folder you will find:
* Main server file (`*.py`)
* Dockerfile to build service image
* Python library requirements (`requirements.txt`)
* `data` folder with the `.json` file that holds the service data
* `protos` folder with the `.proto` file of the service describing its stubs

### Running locally

make
cd movie
python3.10 movie.py
cd showtime
python3.10 showtime.py
cd booking
python3.10 booking.py
cd user
python3.10 user.py [-H HOST] -p PORT
```

### Running with Docker

docker-compose up [--build] ${SERVICE}
